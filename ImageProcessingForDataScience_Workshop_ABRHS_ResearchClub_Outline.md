### Workshop Title:  
**Image processing hands on workshop**

### Workshop Date:  
December 10 2024  

## Welcome to the "__Image processing hands on workshop__", scheduled to take place on December 10 2024, within the **Data Science track** of the ABRHS Research Club. 
  
### Workshop Objective:  
Hands on tutorial session focused on fundamentals of image processing for data science projects, including kernel convolution, and edge detection using python and open-source Python libraries for scientific computing like numpy and pandas. 

### Workshop Outline: 
Concepts:

- Meet Lena  
- What is an image?  
- What actually is an image?  
- The most basic coding pattern for image processing  
- Real example of image processing  
- Kernel convolution:  
  1) Vertical edges   
  2) Horizontal edges   
  3) Blurring   
  4) Sharpening  
  5) Embossing
